# *Time Series - (m11_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
In a bid to drive revenue, you’ll produce a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. You’ll use text and comments to document your findings, and you’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions.

When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

This project is designed to perform the following tasks:
<br>

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.
<br>
### ***Task 4:***<br>
Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.
<br>
### ***Task 5:***<br>
(Optional) A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.
<br>
### ***Task 6:***<br>
Visualize the Results.
